To view page, open index.html in your browser. I used Chrome to debug.

I assumed that the user will input a zip code into the search box as it they are interested in their area in particular. 

From the API, I pulled from the county, district and place divisions as I see the main functionality of the US Representative Search as a way for people to search for politicians that they may have better access to-- not the President, for example, as it is unlikely for the the public to reach him with their individual needs. 

Only when the "Office" checkbox is checked do the results include the offices. Otherwise will only return information about the represenatatives individually.
